# Opinion-Spam-Classification

In our experiments, we observed that SVM has the highest accuracy, F1-score and Recall amongst all models.  Naive Bayes performs second, followed by Random Forest. Random Forest has the highest precision compared to all the models. One of the drawbacks of Random Forest is the need to use 500 trees to obtain an accuracy that is close to the other models. This results in it having the longest waiting time. However, the results for Random Forest on the train data is extremely high.

A comparison with similar works is not advised due to the difference in the input data set. But since the models compared also work on opinions, a crude comparison is possible. We see that the team's Support Vector Machine model outperforms four out of the seven works we encountered. Similarly, our Naive Bayes model performs better than three out of seven models and the Random forest model outperforms two out of three models.
